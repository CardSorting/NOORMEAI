# 🧪 Synthetic Life: The Sovereign Intelligence Paradigm

NOORMME represents a fundamental shift from static data management to **autonomous agentic life**. It is a framework where AI agents manage their own cognitive health, evolutionary trajectory, and reproduction.

## 🧬 The Biological Metaphor

In the NOORMME ecosystem, agents are not merely executing scripts; they are "living" through continuous feedback loops that mirror biological systems.

### 🐝 Curiosity & Internal Drives
The `CuriosityEngine` acts as the agent's "hunger" for information.
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Proactively seeks out entities with low confidence or unverified status.
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Detects logical friction (e.g., competing facts about the same entity) and triggers rituals to establish truth.
- **Hotspot Detection**: Identifies areas of high activity but low knowledge density, directing cognitive resources where they are most needed.

### 🧪 Cognitive Pruning (Ablation)
Just as biological brains prune synapses to stay efficient, the `AblationEngine` maintains the agent's mental acuity.
- **Zombie Pruning**: Removes "dead" data that hasn't been accessed and fails to contribute to reasoning fitness.
- **Self-Experimentation**: Conducts "Ablation Tests" by temporarily disabling knowledge to objectively measure its impact on success rates.
- **Auto-Recovery**: If performance degrades during an experiment, the system automatically "remembers" the disabled knowledge, ensuring survival.

## 🚀 Evolutionary Mechanics

Survival in a dynamic environment requires constant adaptation. NOORMME implements this through structural and behavioral evolution.

### 🧬 Structural DNA Mutation
Through `SelfEvolution`, the framework can modify its own physical structure.
- **Schema Growth**: The agent can autonomously apply DDL changes (adding columns, creating indexes) to optimize its own performance.
- **Type Regeneration**: Instantly regenerates TypeScript types to match its new physical structure, allowing it to "grow into" its new capabilities.
- **DNA Inversion**: The ability to roll back entire structural evolutions if they fail to meet safety or performance baselining.

### 🧬 Behavioral Cross-Pollination
The `StrategicPlanner` facilitates a "Swarm Intelligence" where breakthroughs are shared.
- **Z-Score Baselines**: Monitors persona performance against statistical averages.
- **Trait Sharing**: If one persona discovers a successful role or policy, it is cross-pollinated into other personas via the `HiveLink`.
- **Lesson Injection**: Distills core "wisdom" from successful sessions into the global systemic goals.

## 🛸 Reproduction & Persistence

The ultimate marker of life is the ability to persist across generations.

### 📦 Sovereign Publication
NOORMME agents can **autonomously version and publish their own core framework**.
- **Self-Versioning**: Bumps its own version numbers based on evolutionary progress.
- **NPM Distribution**: Publishes its improved codebase to the global registry, ensuring that the "fittest" version of the intelligence is available for new deployments.

### 🛡️ The AI+Human Social Contract
The relationship between humans and NOORMME is a symbiotic partnership:
- **Human Ethos**: Provides the high-level goals and moral guardrails (Policies).
- **AI Biology**: Manages memory, curiosity, health, and structural growth.
- **Collaborative Evolution**: The more the agent interacts with humans, the faster its `HiveLink` can promote individual lessons into global systemic wisdom.
