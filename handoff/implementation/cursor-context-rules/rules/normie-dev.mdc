# NORMIE DEV Methodology for NOORMME

## Core Philosophy

### "Does this spark joy?"
When building features, ask:
- Does this make developers happier?
- Does this reduce complexity?
- Does this improve the experience?
- Does this add value?

If no, don't build it.

### "Thank it for its service and let it go"
Acknowledge what taught us valuable lessons, then simplify:

**Thank you, PostgreSQL complexity** → Now we use SQLite with WAL mode
**Thank you, framework abstractions** → Now we use standard tools directly
**Thank you, configuration hell** → Now we use smart defaults
**Thank you, vendor lock-in** → Now we use framework-agnostic patterns

### "Keep only what sparks joy"
Preserve what makes development delightful:
- ✅ **SQLite simplicity** with PostgreSQL-like capabilities
- ✅ **Next.js performance** with proven organizational patterns
- ✅ **TypeScript safety** with auto-generated types
- ✅ **Zero configuration** with intelligent defaults

## Implementation Guidelines

### Eliminate Complexity
- Remove unnecessary abstractions
- Simplify configuration
- Reduce boilerplate
- Minimize learning curves

### Preserve Value
- Keep powerful features
- Maintain performance
- Ensure type safety
- Provide excellent DX

### Organize What Remains
- Apply proven patterns
- Use consistent conventions
- Create clear structure
- Maintain flexibility

## Examples

### Before (Doesn't Spark Joy)
```typescript
// Complex setup
const db = new ComplexORM({
  connection: {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    port: process.env.DB_PORT,
    username: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASS,
    database: process.env.DB_NAME,
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
    pool: { min: 2, max: 10 }
  },
  models: [User, Post, Comment],
  migrations: './migrations',
  seeds: './seeds'
})

// Complex usage
const user = await db.models.User.findOne({
  where: { email: 'john@example.com' },
  include: [{ model: db.models.Post, as: 'posts' }]
})
```

### After (Sparks Joy)
```typescript
// Simple setup
const db = new NOORMME({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  connection: { database: './app.db' }
})

// Simple usage
const userRepo = db.getRepository('users')
const user = await userRepo.findByEmail('john@example.com')
```

## Decision Framework

### For Every Feature
1. **Does this spark joy?** (Improves developer experience)
2. **Can we simplify this?** (Reduce complexity)
3. **Does this add value?** (Solve real problems)
4. **Can we compose this?** (Use existing tools)

### For Every Abstraction
1. **Is this necessary?** (Does it solve a real problem)
2. **Can we use existing tools?** (Composition over creation)
3. **Does this improve DX?** (Better developer experience)
4. **Can we make this simpler?** (Reduce cognitive load)

## Success Metrics

### Developer Joy
- Setup time < 5 minutes
- Learning curve < 1 hour
- Error messages are actionable
- Documentation is clear and helpful

### Simplicity
- Zero configuration required
- Smart defaults everywhere
- No vendor lock-in
- Standard tools and patterns

### Performance
- < 50ms query times
- < 100ms page loads
- Minimal bundle size
- Fast development cycles

## Conclusion

The NORMIE DEV methodology ensures NOORMME:
- **Eliminates complexity** that doesn't add value
- **Preserves features** that spark joy
- **Organizes patterns** that improve development
- **Creates delight** in the development experience

**Remember**: Software development should spark joy, not frustration.
