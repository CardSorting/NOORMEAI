# Why NOORMME? (The Agentic Data Engine)

## High-Fidelity Persistence for Autonomous Intelligence

Traditional ORMs were built for humans. NOORMME is built for **Agents**.

While tools like Prisma and Drizzle focus on Developer Experience (DX), NOORMME focuses on **Agentic Experience (AX)**.

## 🏛️ The Agentic Moats

To survive in production, an autonomous agent needs more than just a query builder; it needs a **Sovereign Persistence Layer**.

### 1. Autonomous Schema Discovery
Agents shouldn't parse code-level abstractions like `schema.prisma`. NOORMME allows agents to discover the physical reality of the database directly at runtime, ensuring there is zero gap between the agent's mental model and the physical data.

### 2. Evolutionary DNA (Structural Growth)
Most data layers are static. NOORMME treats your schema as **Living DNA**. 
- Agents can autonomously propose and apply schema mutations (DDL).
- **DNA Inversion**: Automated, safe rollbacks if a mutation causes a "Logic Violation" or "Performance Drift".

### 3. Performance Drift Probes
Standard ORMs are silent about regressions. NOORMME's **Governance Engine** continuously monitors the Z-Score of query execution. If a structural change causes latency to drift beyond the sovereignty threshold, the **Autonomous Rituals** trigger a repair or rollback.

### 4. Sovereign Memory (Session-Persistence)
NOORMME provides built-in, session-aware tables for **Episodic Memories** and **Strategic Goals**, ensuring context is never lost across disjointed agentic reasoning loops.

## 🎯 When to Use NOORMME

### Use NOORMME if you are building:
- **Autonomous Agents**: Systems that reason, plan, and evolve their own logic.
- **Sovereign Databases**: Persistence layers that must heal and optimize themselves without human intervention.
- **High-Throughput Memory**: Applications requiring `pgvector` neural storage fused with relational integrity.

### Stick with Legacy ORMs if:
- You prefer manual control over every schema change.
- Your application logic is static and human-led.
- You do not require autonomous performance monitoring.
