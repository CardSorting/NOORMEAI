# NOORMME Architecture Guidelines

## Core Principles

### NORMIE DEV Methodology
- Keep only what sparks joy (simplicity, performance, organization)
- Thank complexity for its service and let it go
- Organize what remains with proven patterns

### Composition over Creation
- Use existing excellent tools (Next.js, Kysely, NextAuth, SQLite)
- Apply proven organizational patterns (Django, Laravel, Rails)
- Compose solutions instead of creating new frameworks
- Maintain flexibility and avoid lock-in

## Architectural Layers

### Layer 1: Core Tools (Existing)
- Next.js: App Router, Server Components, Server Actions
- Kysely: Type-safe SQL query builder
- NextAuth: Authentication for Next.js
- SQLite: Simple, reliable database with WAL mode
- TypeScript: Full type safety

### Layer 2: NOORMME Automation (New)
- Auto-Discovery: Schema introspection and type generation
- Repository Pattern: Type-safe CRUD operations
- Performance Optimization: WAL mode, caching, index recommendations
- CLI Tools: Database management and project scaffolding

### Layer 3: Organizational Patterns (New)
- Django Structure: Organized folders, clear separation of concerns
- Laravel Services: Service classes, repository patterns
- Rails Conventions: Naming conventions, file organization
- Next.js Patterns: App Router, Server Components

### Layer 4: Templates (New)
- Project Templates: Pre-organized Next.js projects
- Code Templates: Common patterns and utilities
- Configuration Templates: Smart defaults and conventions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Modular Architecture
- Organize code into distinct modules within `src/` directory
- Separate concerns: database, services, components, utilities
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Ensure all modules are stateless and pure functions where possible

### Service Layer Pattern
- Encapsulate business logic in service classes
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Implement middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Follow single responsibility principle

### Error Handling
- Use standardized error types with actionable messages
- Implement error recovery mechanisms
- Provide comprehensive error documentation
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
